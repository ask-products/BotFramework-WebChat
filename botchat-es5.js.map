It\n     * might be for example a function that you passed to a {@link create} static factory, but most of the time it is\n     * a library implementation, which defines what and when will be emitted by an Observable. This means that calling\n     * `subscribe` is actually the moment when Observable starts its work, not when it is created, as it is often\n     * thought.\n     *\n     * Apart from starting the execution of an Observable, this method allows you to listen for values\n     * that an Observable emits, as well as for when it completes or errors. You can achieve this in two\n     * following ways.\n     *\n     * The first way is creating an object that implements {@link Observer} interface. It should have methods\n     * defined by that interface, but note that it should be just a regular JavaScript object, which you can create\n     * yourself in any way you want (ES6 class, classic function constructor, object literal etc.). In particular do\n     * not attempt to use any RxJS implementation details to create Observers - you don't need them. Remember also\n     * that your object does not have to implement all methods. If you find yourself creating a method that doesn't\n     * do anything, you can simply omit it. Note however, that if `error` method is not provided, all errors will\n     * be left uncaught.\n     *\n     * The second way is to give up on Observer object altogether and simply provide callback functions in place of its methods.\n     * This means you can provide three functions as arguments to `subscribe`, where first function is equivalent\n     * of a `next` method, second of an `error` method and third of a `complete` method. Just as in case of Observer,\n     * if you do not need to listen for something, you can omit a function, preferably by passing `undefined` or `null`,\n     * since `subscribe` recognizes these functions by where they were placed in function call. When it comes\n     * to `error` function, just as before, if not provided, errors emitted by an Observable will be thrown.\n     *\n     * Whatever style of calling `subscribe` you use, in both cases it returns a Subscription object.\n     * This object allows you to call `unsubscribe` on it, which in turn will stop work that an Observable does and will clean\n     * up all resources that an Observable used.

It might be useful, if you do not have control over\n * internal scheduler of a given Observable, but want to control when its values are emitted nevertheless.\n *\n * Returned Observable emits the same notifications (nexted values, complete and error events) as the source Observable,\n * but rescheduled with provided scheduler.

Enables all available rules,\n *   but still without html, typographer & autolinker.\n * - [\"zero\"](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/presets/zero.js) -\n *   all rules disabled. Useful to quickly setup your config via `.enable()`.\n *   For example, when you need only `bold` and `italic` markup and nothing else.\n *\n * ##### options:\n *\n * - __html__ - `false`. Set `true` to enable HTML tags in source. Be careful!\n *   That's not safe! You may need external sanitizer to protect output from XSS.\n *   It's better to extend features via plugins, instead of enabling HTML.\n * - __xhtmlOut__ - `false`. Set `true` to add '/' when closing single tags\n *   (`<br />`). This is needed only for full CommonMark compatibility. In real\n *   world you will need HTML output.\n * - __breaks__ - `false`. Set `true` to convert `\\n` in paragraphs into `<br>`.\n * - __langPrefix__ - `language-`. CSS language class prefix for fenced blocks.\n *   Can be useful for external highlighters.\n * - __linkify__ - `false`. Set `true` to autoconvert URL-like text to links.\n * - __typographer__  - `false`. Set `true` to enable [some language-neutral\n *   replacement](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/rules_core/replacements.js) +\n *   quotes beautification (smartquotes).\n * - __quotes__ - `“”‘’`, String or Array. Double + single quotes replacement\n *   pairs, when typographer enabled and smartquotes on. For example, you can\n *   use `'«»„“'` for Russian, `'„“‚‘'` for German, and\n *   `['«\\xA0', '\\xA0»', '‹\\xA0', '\\xA0›']` for French (including nbsp).\n * - __highlight__ - `null`. Highlighter function for fenced code blocks.\n *   Highlighter `function (str, lang)` should return escaped HTML. It can also\n *   return empty string if the source was not changed and should be escaped\n *   externaly. If result starts with <pre... internal wrapper is skipped.\n *\n * ##### Example\n *\n * ```javascript\n * // commonmark mode\n * var md = require('markdown-it')('commonmark');\n *\n * // default mode\n * var md = require('markdown-it')();\n *\n * // enable everything\n * var md = require('markdown-it')({\n *   html: true,\n *   linkify: true,\n *   typographer: true\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * ##### Syntax highlighting\n *\n * ```js\n * var hljs = require('highlight.js') // https://highlightjs.org/\n *\n * var md = require('markdown-it')({\n *   highlight: function (str, lang) {\n *     if (lang && hljs.getLanguage(lang)) {\n *       try {\n *         return hljs.highlight(lang, str, true).value;\n *       } catch (__) {}\n *     }\n *\n *     return ''; // use external default escaping\n *   }\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * Or with full wrapper override (if you need assign class to `<pre>`):\n *\n * ```javascript\n * var hljs = require('highlight.js') // https://highlightjs.org/\n *\n * // Actual default values\n * var md = require('markdown-it')({\n *   highlight: function (str, lang) {\n *     if (lang && hljs.getLanguage(lang)) {\n *       try {\n *         return '<pre class=\"hljs\"><code>' +\n *                hljs.highlight(lang, str, true).value +\n *                '</code></pre>';\n *       } catch (__) {}\n *     }\n *\n *     return '<pre class=\"hljs\"><code>' + md.utils.escapeHtml(str) + '</code></pre>';\n *   }\n * });\n * ```\n *\n **/\nfunction MarkdownIt(presetName, options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof MarkdownIt)) {\n    return new MarkdownIt(presetName, options);\n  }\n\n  if (!options) {\n    if (!utils.isString(presetName)) {\n      options = presetName || {};\n      presetName = 'default';\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * MarkdownIt#inline -> ParserInline\n   *\n   * Instance of [[ParserInline]].

It\n     * might be for example a function that you passed to a {@link create} static factory, but most of the time it is\n     * a library implementation, which defines what and when will be emitted by an Observable. This means that calling\n     * `subscribe` is actually the moment when Observable starts its work, not when it is created, as it is often\n     * thought.\n     *\n     * Apart from starting the execution of an Observable, this method allows you to listen for values\n     * that an Observable emits, as well as for when it completes or errors. You can achieve this in two\n     * following ways.\n     *\n     * The first way is creating an object that implements {@link Observer} interface. It should have methods\n     * defined by that interface, but note that it should be just a regular JavaScript object, which you can create\n     * yourself in any way you want (ES6 class, classic function constructor, object literal etc.). In particular do\n     * not attempt to use any RxJS implementation details to create Observers - you don't need them. Remember also\n     * that your object does not have to implement all methods. If you find yourself creating a method that doesn't\n     * do anything, you can simply omit it. Note however, that if `error` method is not provided, all errors will\n     * be left uncaught.\n     *\n     * The second way is to give up on Observer object altogether and simply provide callback functions in place of its methods.\n     * This means you can provide three functions as arguments to `subscribe`, where first function is equivalent\n     * of a `next` method, second of an `error` method and third of a `complete` method. Just as in case of Observer,\n     * if you do not need to listen for something, you can omit a function, preferably by passing `undefined` or `null`,\n     * since `subscribe` recognizes these functions by where they were placed in function call. When it comes\n     * to `error` function, just as before, if not provided, errors emitted by an Observable will be thrown.\n     *\n     * Whatever style of calling `subscribe` you use, in both cases it returns a Subscription object.\n     * This object allows you to call `unsubscribe` on it, which in turn will stop work that an Observable does and will clean\n     * up all resources that an Observable used. Note that cancelling a subscription will not call `complete` callback\n     * provided to `subscribe` function, which is reserved for a regular completion signal that comes from an Observable.\n     *\n     * Remember that callbacks provided to `subscribe` are not guaranteed to be called asynchronously.\n     * It is an Observable itself that decides when these functions will be called. For example {@link of}\n     * by default emits all its values synchronously. Always check documentation for how given Observable\n     * will behave when subscribed and if its default behavior can be modified with a {@link Scheduler}.\n     *\n     * @example <caption>Subscribe with an Observer</caption>\n     * const sumObserver = {\n     *   sum: 0,\n     *   next(value) {\n     *     console.log('Adding: ' + value);\n     *     this.sum = this.sum + value;\n     *   },\n     *   error() { // We actually could just remove this method,\n     *   },        // since we do not really care about errors right now.\n     *   complete() {\n     *     console.log('Sum equals: ' + this.sum);\n     *   }\n     * };\n     *\n     * Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3) // Synchronously emits 1, 2, 3 and then completes.\n     * .subscribe(sumObserver);\n     *\n     * // Logs:\n     * // \"Adding: 1\"\n     * // \"Adding: 2\"\n     * // \"Adding: 3\"\n     * // \"Sum equals: 6\"\n     *\n     *\n     * @example <caption>Subscribe with functions</caption>\n     * let sum = 0;\n     *\n     * Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3)\n     * .subscribe(\n     *   function(value) {\n     *     console.log('Adding: ' + value);\n     *     sum = sum + value;\n     *   },\n     *   undefined,\n     *   function() {\n     *     console.log('Sum equals: ' + sum);\n     *   }\n     * );\n     *\n     * // Logs:\n     * // \"Adding: 1\"\n     * // \"Adding: 2\"\n     * // \"Adding: 3\"\n     * // \"Sum equals: 6\"\n     *\n     *\n     * @example <caption>Cancel a subscription</caption>\n     * const subscription = Rx.Observable.interval(1000).subscribe(\n     *   num => console.log(num),\n     *   undefined,\n     *   () => console.log('completed!') // Will not be called, even\n     * );                                // when cancelling subscription\n     *\n     *\n     * setTimeout(() => {\n     *   subscription.unsubscribe();\n     *   console.log('unsubscribed!');\n     * }, 2500);\n     *\n     * // Logs:\n     * // 0 after 1s\n     * // 1 after 2s\n     * // \"unsubscribed!\" after 2.5s\n     *\n     *\n     * @param {Observer|Function} observerOrNext (optional) Either an observer with methods to be called,\n     *  or the first of three possible handlers, which is the handler for each value emitted from the subscribed\n     *  Observable.\n     * @param {Function} error (optional) A handler for a terminal event resulting from an error.

It might be useful, if you do not have control over\n * internal scheduler of a given Observable, but want to control when its values are emitted nevertheless.\n *\n * Returned Observable emits the same notifications (nexted values, complete and error events) as the source Observable,\n * but rescheduled with provided scheduler. Note that this doesn't mean that source Observables internal\n * scheduler will be replaced in any way. Original scheduler still will be used, but when the source Observable emits\n * notification, it will be immediately scheduled again - this time with scheduler passed to `observeOn`.\n * An anti-pattern would be calling `observeOn` on Observable that emits lots of values synchronously, to split\n * that emissions into asynchronous chunks. For this to happen, scheduler would have to be passed into the source\n * Observable directly (usually into the operator that creates it). `observeOn` simply delays notifications a\n * little bit more, to ensure that they are emitted at expected moments.\n *\n * As a matter of fact, `observeOn` accepts second parameter, which specifies in milliseconds with what delay notifications\n * will be emitted.

Can be called without `new`.\n *\n * ##### presetName\n *\n * MarkdownIt provides named presets as a convenience to quickly\n * enable/disable active syntax rules and options for common use cases.\n *\n * - [\"commonmark\"](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/presets/commonmark.js) -\n *   configures parser to strict [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/) mode.\n * - [default](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/presets/default.js) -\n *   similar to GFM, used when no preset name given. Enables all available rules,\n *   but still without html, typographer & autolinker.\n * - [\"zero\"](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/presets/zero.js) -\n *   all rules disabled. Useful to quickly setup your config via `.enable()`.\n *   For example, when you need only `bold` and `italic` markup and nothing else.\n *\n * ##### options:\n *\n * - __html__ - `false`. Set `true` to enable HTML tags in source. Be careful!\n *   That's not safe! You may need external sanitizer to protect output from XSS.\n *   It's better to extend features via plugins, instead of enabling HTML.\n * - __xhtmlOut__ - `false`. Set `true` to add '/' when closing single tags\n *   (`<br />`). This is needed only for full CommonMark compatibility. In real\n *   world you will need HTML output.\n * - __breaks__ - `false`. Set `true` to convert `\\n` in paragraphs into `<br>`.\n * - __langPrefix__ - `language-`. CSS language class prefix for fenced blocks.\n *   Can be useful for external highlighters.\n * - __linkify__ - `false`. Set `true` to autoconvert URL-like text to links.\n * - __typographer__  - `false`. Set `true` to enable [some language-neutral\n *   replacement](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/rules_core/replacements.js) +\n *   quotes beautification (smartquotes).\n * - __quotes__ - `“”‘’`, String or Array. Double + single quotes replacement\n *   pairs, when typographer enabled and smartquotes on. For example, you can\n *   use `'«»„“'` for Russian, `'„“‚‘'` for German, and\n *   `['«\\xA0', '\\xA0»', '‹\\xA0', '\\xA0›']` for French (including nbsp).\n * - __highlight__ - `null`. Highlighter function for fenced code blocks.\n *   Highlighter `function (str, lang)` should return escaped HTML. It can also\n *   return empty string if the source was not changed and should be escaped\n *   externaly. If result starts with <pre... internal wrapper is skipped.\n *\n * ##### Example\n *\n * ```javascript\n * // commonmark mode\n * var md = require('markdown-it')('commonmark');\n *\n * // default mode\n * var md = require('markdown-it')();\n *\n * // enable everything\n * var md = require('markdown-it')({\n *   html: true,\n *   linkify: true,\n *   typographer: true\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * ##### Syntax highlighting\n *\n * ```js\n * var hljs = require('highlight.js') // https://highlightjs.org/\n *\n * var md = require('markdown-it')({\n *   highlight: function (str, lang) {\n *     if (lang && hljs.getLanguage(lang)) {\n *       try {\n *         return hljs.highlight(lang, str, true).value;\n *       } catch (__) {}\n *     }\n *\n *     return ''; // use external default escaping\n *   }\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * Or with full wrapper override (if you need assign class to `<pre>`):\n *\n * ```javascript\n * var hljs = require('highlight.js') // https://highlightjs.org/\n *\n * // Actual default values\n * var md = require('markdown-it')({\n *   highlight: function (str, lang) {\n *     if (lang && hljs.getLanguage(lang)) {\n *       try {\n *         return '<pre class=\"hljs\"><code>' +\n *                hljs.highlight(lang, str, true).value +\n *                '</code></pre>';\n *       } catch (__) {}\n *     }\n *\n *     return '<pre class=\"hljs\"><code>' + md.utils.escapeHtml(str) + '</code></pre>';\n *   }\n * });\n * ```\n *\n **/\nfunction MarkdownIt(presetName, options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof MarkdownIt)) {\n    return new MarkdownIt(presetName, options);\n  }\n\n  if (!options) {\n    if (!utils.isString(presetName)) {\n      options = presetName || {};\n      presetName = 'default';\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * MarkdownIt#inline -> ParserInline\n   *\n   * Instance of [[ParserInline]].
